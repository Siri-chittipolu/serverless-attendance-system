# Serverless Attendance System using AWS Rekognition (In Progress)

This is a serverless attendance system built using **React** on the frontend and **AWS Rekognition**, **Lambda**, **S3**, and **DynamoDB** on the backend. The goal is to provide a face-recognition-based attendance system with minimal infrastructure management, relying entirely on AWS serverless services.


---

##  Project Goal

Build a fully functional attendance system that:
- Uses **webcam capture** to take a photo of a user
- Uploads the photo to **Amazon S3**
- Triggers a **Lambda function** to detect and match the face using **AWS Rekognition**
- Logs attendance in **DynamoDB**
- Provides **real-time feedback** to the frontend (e.g., "Marked Present", "No Match")
- Includes **login authentication** via **AWS Cognito**
